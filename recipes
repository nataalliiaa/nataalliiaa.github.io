<p><strong class="steps">Step 1</strong> Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch square cake pan.</p>
<p><strong class="steps">Step 2</strong> Cream sugar and butter together in a mixing bowl. Add eggs, one at a time, beating briefly after each addition. Mix in vanilla.</p>
<p><strong class="steps">Step 3</strong> Combine flour and baking powder in a separate bowl. Add to the wet ingredients and mix well. Add milk and stir until smooth.</p>
<p><strong class="steps">Step 4</strong> Pour batter into the prepared cake pan.</p>
<p><strong class="steps">Step 5</strong> Bake in the preheated oven until the top springs back when lightly touched, 30 to 40 minutes.</p>
<p><strong class="steps">Step 6</strong> Remove from the oven and cool completely. Frost and enjoy!</p>

       <p><strong>How to make?</strong></p>
       <p><strong class="steps">Step 1</strong> Combine the dry ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer.
Add the water and allow the mixer to knead for 5-7 minutes, until the dough peels itself away from the edge of the bowl. At this point, the dough will feel a little tacky but should not be too sticky to work with. 
Roll it out into a rectangle – the gluten might not let it stretch far so it doesn’t matter if it’s quite 10×16 yet. Wrap the pan in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for at least 4 hours or overnight.</p>
<p><strong class="steps">Step 2 </strong> Fold a large piece of parchment paper into an 8×10” rectangle by folding each end in until one side measures 8″ and one side measures 10″.
Slice the sticks of butter in half just so they’re easier to spread out.
Place the slightly chilled butter (not fresh out of the fridge but not too soft either) in the parchment paper and use a rolling pin to smush it into the size of the rectangle.
Refrigerate the butter for 10-20 minutes or longer but make sure to bring it back to a malleable temperature before laminating.</p>
<p><strong class="steps">Step 3</strong> Now that the dough has relaxed, roll it out into a 10×16” rectangle, onto a floured surface. Try to get it nice and even around the edge – you can slightly trim it if it’s not straight but it’s not a big deal. 
Place the butter on top of the dough, in the center, lining up the edges so you’ll have the 10” side of the dough parallel with the 10” side of the butter. 
Fold the top ⅓ of the dough down over the butter and then fold the bottom ⅓ of the dough up on top of itself, so the two edges of dough meet in the middle of the butter. Seal the edges by pinching them together a little.
Then turn the dough 90 degrees and GENTLY roll it back out into 10×16”. I like to press the rolling pin into the dough a little, roll it 1/2 an inch or so and press down again (watch the video).
Fold it again into thirds, like an envelope this time so the bottom 1/3 overlaps the top 1/3 of the dough . 
Cover the dough with the plastic wrap again and refrigerate it for 10-20 minutes. 
Roll the dough back out into a 10×16” rectangle, fold it into thirds again, cover and refrigerate for another 10-20 minutes and repeat one more time after this.
Refrigerate the dough for at least 2 hours now. </p>
<p><strong class="steps">Step 4</strong> Remove the dough from the fridge for about 15 minutes before rolling it out again into a 12×24” rectangle.
Slice the dough into triangles from long end to long end. I like to use a pizza cutter. 
Roll each croissant up starting with the fat end of the triangle. Press down on the tip a little so that they stay flat. Place on a baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and let them rise for 2-3 hours at room temperature. </p>
<p><strong class="steps">Step 5</strong> Beat an egg with a fork until it’s loose. Brush each croissant with the egg wash. I like to do this twice just so it gets nice coverage. 
Bake until they’re just a little darker than golden brown. 
Allow them to cool before serving.</p>
